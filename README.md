# Project Name
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. To understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
Goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.

## General Information
- This is a case study to build a model using Linear Regression techniques. 
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. To understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
Goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- The data set consists of various independent variables such as weather condition, year, day of week and also a target variable representing the count of bike sales on a particular day.

## Conclusions
- Categorical Variables have impact on the Model.
- temp, weathersit, and yr are the top most features that significantly impact the demand of shared bikes.
